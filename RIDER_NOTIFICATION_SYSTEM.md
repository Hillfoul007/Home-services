# Rider Notification & Order Assignment System

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive rider notification system and improves order assignment workflow. When an admin assigns an order to a rider, the rider receives immediate notifications and assigned orders are properly filtered to prevent visibility to other riders.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Rider Notifications System

#### Backend Components
- **RiderNotification Model** (`backend/models/RiderNotification.js`)
  - Comprehensive notification schema with support for different types
  - Automatic expiry for time-sensitive notifications
  - Tracking of delivery status (app, SMS, push)
  - Support for action-required notifications

- **RiderNotificationService** (`backend/services/riderNotificationService.js`)
  - Service layer for managing rider notifications
  - SMS integration via existing DVHosting API
  - Support for order assignment, update, and general notifications
  - Cleanup utilities for old notifications

#### Frontend Components
- **RiderNotifications Component** (`src/components/rider/RiderNotifications.tsx`)
  - Full-featured notification display with filtering
  - Compact mode for dashboard integration
  - Real-time unread count tracking
  - Mark as read functionality

- **RiderNotificationsPage** (`src/pages/rider/RiderNotificationsPage.tsx`)
  - Dedicated page for viewing all notifications
  - Accessible via rider navigation menu

### 2. Order Visibility Filtering

#### Admin Side
- Modified admin orders API to exclude assigned orders by default
- Added `includeAssigned` parameter for complete order visibility
- Proper filtering for both regular bookings and quick pickups

#### Rider Side
- Rider orders API now only returns orders assigned to that specific rider
- Support for both Booking and QuickPickup collections
- Excludes completed orders to keep active order list clean

### 3. Live Rider Location Tracking

#### AdminLiveMap Component (`src/components/AdminLiveMap.tsx`)
- Real-time rider location display with auto-refresh
- Location freshness indicators (fresh, recent, stale, old)
- Integration with Google Maps for individual rider viewing
- Full-screen mode support
- Detailed rider information panel

#### Integration
- Added to AdminRiderManagement as "Live Tracking" tab
- Automatic updates every 30 seconds
- Displays active riders with their current assignments

### 4. Enhanced Order Assignment

#### Notification Integration
- Order assignment automatically sends notifications to riders
- SMS notifications via existing DVHosting SMS API
- Notification status included in assignment response
- Support for both regular orders and quick pickups

#### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if notification sending fails
- Assignment still succeeds even if notification fails
- Proper logging for debugging

### 5. SMS Integration

#### DVHosting API Integration
- Extended existing OTP service to support general SMS
- Uses same API key and configuration
- Automatic SMS on order assignment
- Development mode fallback for testing

## API Endpoints Added/Modified

### Rider Endpoints
- `GET /api/riders/notifications` - Get rider notifications
- `POST /api/riders/notifications/:id/read` - Mark notification as read
- `POST /api/riders/notifications/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read
- `GET /api/riders/notifications/unread-count` - Get unread count
- `GET /api/riders/orders` - Get assigned orders (modified to filter properly)

### Admin Endpoints
- `GET /api/admin/orders` - Modified to support assignment filtering
- `POST /api/admin/orders/assign` - Enhanced with notification sending
- `POST /api/admin/quick-pickups/assign` - Enhanced with notification sending

## Database Models

### RiderNotification Schema
```javascript
{
  rider_id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  message: String,
  type: 'order_assigned' | 'order_updated' | 'order_cancelled' | 'general' | 'location_request',
  read: Boolean,
  data: Mixed, // Order details, customer info, etc.
  action_required: Boolean,
  action_type: String,
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent',
  sent_via: ['app', 'sms', 'push'],
  delivery_status: {
    app: Boolean,
    sms: Boolean,
    push: Boolean
  },
  expires_at: Date,
  related_order: ObjectId,
  related_quick_pickup: ObjectId
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DVHOSTING_API_KEY` - Required for SMS notifications
- Existing configuration is reused for consistency

### Frontend Configuration
- API URLs automatically detect environment (localhost vs production)
- Fallback to production backend for reliability

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Admin Workflow
1. Login to admin portal
2. Navigate to Riders → Live Tracking to see active riders
3. Go to Orders → Assignment to assign orders
4. Verify notification status in assignment response

### 2. Rider Workflow
1. Login as rider and go active
2. Check dashboard for notification summary
3. Navigate to Notifications page for full list
4. Verify unread count badge in navigation

### 3. Notification Testing
1. Assign order to active rider
2. Check rider receives notification in app
3. Verify SMS is sent (check logs in dev mode)
4. Confirm assigned order is not visible to other riders

## Development Notes

### Demo Mode Support
- All components work in demo mode when database is unavailable
- Sample data provided for testing UI components
- Graceful fallbacks for network errors

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling in all API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging purposes

### Performance Considerations
- Notification auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Location updates cached for efficiency
- Unread count polling optimized

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Push Notifications**: Integration with FCM/APNS for mobile apps
2. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for instant notifications
3. **Notification Categories**: More granular notification types
4. **Batch Operations**: Bulk assignment with notifications
5. **Analytics**: Notification delivery and read rates

### Scalability
- Current implementation supports moderate rider volumes
- For high volume, consider:
  - Queue-based notification processing
  - Database sharding for notifications
  - CDN for static assets
  - Load balancing for API endpoints

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens required for all rider endpoints
- Admin token verification for admin operations
- Proper session management

### Data Protection
- Phone numbers cleaned before SMS sending
- Sensitive data excluded from logs
- Proper input validation on all endpoints

### Rate Limiting
- Consider implementing rate limiting for SMS endpoints
- Notification frequency controls to prevent spam

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **SMS Not Sending**: Check DVHOSTING_API_KEY configuration
2. **Notifications Not Appearing**: Verify rider authentication
3. **Location Not Updating**: Check rider active status
4. **Orders Not Filtering**: Verify assignment status in database

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check notification status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" /api/riders/notifications/unread-count

# Verify order assignment
curl -H "admin-token: admin-access-granted" /api/admin/orders?includeAssigned=true

# Test SMS sending (dev mode)
# Check server logs for SMS API responses
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust foundation for rider notifications and order management. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly while providing real-time updates and proper data filtering.

The modular design allows for easy extension and modification as business requirements evolve.
